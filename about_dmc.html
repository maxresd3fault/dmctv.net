						<p><a target="_blank" href="/images/maxres/quake.jpg"><img class="image-right-a" src="/images/quake.webp" alt="quake.webp" width="200" height="125"></a>Deathmatch Classic (often abbreviated as DMC, not to be confused with <em>Devil May Cry</em>) is an arena shooter released on June 7th, 2001 by Valve. It was developed as a tribute to id Software for their creation of the Quake series (Quake 1 shown to the right), and to thank id for their contribution to Valve by allowing them to use their game engine. The engine, originally developed for Quake, was heavily modified by Valve and became the GoldSrc engine. GoldSrc was then used to make many games including the likes of the original Half-Life, Team Fortress, Counter-Strike, and many others, including DMC.</p>
						<p>DMC is said to have taken around three months to develop. Given that the game largely pulls from Half-Life's assets, it can be assumed only one or two people at Valve were dedicating their time to developing it. Much of that time was likely spent exclusively on mapping. The game first appeared as a free download on June 7th of 2001, then on June 11th was included as a mod in a patch for Half-Life. Today, it is sold separately on the Steam Store as its own game. DMC only ever received one content update (excluding general GoldSrc engine updates), which added two new maps: <em>p_se_3</em> and <em>dcdm5</em>.</p>
						<p>There was originally a planned update/expansion, <a href="https://half-life.fandom.com/wiki/Half-Life:_Threewave" target="_blank">Threewave CTF</a>, that was scratched and never released by Valve. However, it was leaked in early 2003. It was a port of the Quake mod Threewave Capture, it would have been a second official game mode for DMC if it had released as intended. The update can be downloaded and played thanks to the Half-Life 2 leak from 2003. But unfortunately, there are generally no servers active.</p>
						<p><a target="_blank" href="/images/maxres/playermdl.jpg"><img class="image-right-a" src="/images/playermdl.webp" alt="playermdl.webp" width="200" height="125"></a>The gameplay and maps in DMC closely mirror the original Quake's multiplayer experience, but it has some qualities that make it stand out next to its counterpart. For example, DMC was created on the aforementioned GoldSrc engine, which has a distinct visual style and vastly different movement mechanics. The game also has a variety of player models originating from Half-Life to choose from, a feature Quake lacked. Like Quake, one can alter the color scheme of their character, but DMC allows you to choose to play as characters like Gordon and Barney. Note that this has no effect on gameplay; it is purely aesthetic.</p>
						<p>DMC is evidently not one of Valve's most popular titles. It's often compared with Ricochet because of its small player count and relatively basic gameplay, at least on the surface. DMC does have charm, however, as both a piece of history and a fun game.</p>
