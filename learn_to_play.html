						<p>The main goal in DMC, assuming you are playing the official deathmatch mode, is to kill as many enemy players as possible. You can find weapons, ammo, armor, powerups, and medkits on the ground to assist you in your fragging. Dead enemies drop a backpack containing the weapons and ammo they had before dying, which you can pick up. Dying doesn't count against you, but it does add a death to the scoreboard, and also takes away any weapons, armor, or power ups you were in possession of. Dying due to self-inflicted damage <em>does</em> take away a frag (a kill), as well as increases your death count.</p>
						<p>The game is fast-paced, comparable to Quake. As mentioned in the above paragraph, there is only one official game mode (Deathmatch), but mods have been made for Team Deathmatch, Capture the Flag, and other modes. Explore multiple public servers to see what different custom plugins they have!</p>
						<p>It should also be noted that the pace and feel of DMC is really dictated by how many players are in a server. Unless you have some friends to play with, it's uncommon to find servers with more than 4-5 players, and even that is rare. A server with only two people in it will probably become a digital version of hide-and-seek, while one with eight or more people is generally quite chaotic and quick. A few servers host bots that you can play against, but most of the time they're not very tough, but they can help you practice your aim.</p>
