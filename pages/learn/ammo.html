						<p><a target="_blank" href="/images/learn/ammo/maxres/backpack.jpg"><img class="image-right-a" src="/images/learn/ammo/backpack.webp" alt="backpack.webp" width="200" height="125"></a>There are four different ammunition types in Deathmatch Classic:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Shotgun Shells</li>
							<li>Nails</li>
							<li>Rockets</li>
							<li>Batteries</li>
						</ul>
						<p>To pick up ammo, simply walk over it and it will be added to your total in the bottom right corner of the screen. The only way to check how much of a certain ammunition you have is to hold a gun that uses it. For example, you must be holding a type of Shotgun to see how many shells you have. Picking up the backpack of a dead player (as pictured on the right) gives you all the ammo they had before dying. This gives you their weapons as well, so if you don't have a Rocket Launcher and the dead player did, you'll get a Rocket Launcher alongside whatever ammo they had.</p>

						<h3>Shotgun Shells</h3>

					<div class="main-content">
						<p><a target="_blank" href="/images/learn/ammo/maxres/shells.jpg"><img class="image-right-a" src="/images/learn/ammo/shells.webp" alt="shells.webp" width="200" height="125"></a>Shotgun shells can be used with the Shotgun or the Super Shotgun. Shells can be found in two variants on the ground: one box in a size of 20 shells and one box in a size of 40 shells. Curiously, they're branded as "Great Buck", which is unique to DMC. This detail is not present in other GoldSrc games. Why Valve decided to create this custom model for DMC is unknown.</p>

						<h3>Nails</h3>

					<div class="main-content">
						<p><a target="_blank" href="/images/learn/ammo/maxres/nails.jpg"><img class="image-right-a" src="/images/learn/ammo/nails.webp" alt="nails.webp" width="200" height="125"></a>Nails can be used with the Nailgun or the Super Nailgun. They can be found in two variants on the ground: one box in a size of 25 nails and one box in a size of 50 nails. The smaller pickup is a singular box, whilst the larger 50 nail pickup is two identical boxes next to each other.</p>

						<h3>Rockets</h3>

					<div class="main-content">
						<p><a target="_blank" href="/images/learn/ammo/maxres/rockets.jpg"><img class="image-right-a" src="/images/learn/ammo/rockets.webp" alt="rockets.webp" width="200" height="125"></a>Rockets can be used with the Grenade Launcher or the Rocket Launcher. They can be found in two variants on the ground: a pile of five rockets and a pile of 10 rockets.</p>

						<h3>Batteries</h3>
						<hr>
					</div>
					<div class="main-content">
						<p><a target="_blank" href="/images/learn/ammo/maxres/batteries.jpg"><img class="image-right-a" src="/images/learn/ammo/batteries.webp" alt="batteries.webp" width="200" height="125"></a>Batteries can be used with the Lightning Gun. They can be found on the ground in sizes of six cells and 12 cells. Batteries provide cells, however, cells are not bullets but rather energy for the Lightning Gun. This ammo tends to be rather scarce and not plentiful on competitive-oriented maps. Strangely, the 12 cell Battery model is unused, and both sizes share the 6 cell model.</p>
