					<h3>Weapons</h3>
					<hr>
					<p>There is a total of eight unique weapons in Deathmatch Classic:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Crowbar (spawn weapon)</li>
						<li>Shotgun (spawn weapon)</li>
						<li>Super Shotgun</li>
						<li>Nailgun</li>
						<li>Super Nailgun</li>
						<li>Grenade Launcher</li>
						<li>Rocket Launcher</li>
						<li>Lightning Gun</li>
					</ul>
					<p>All eight of these weapons have unique features that vastly differentiate them from one another. While theoretically you could simply pick up a lightning gun and slay noobs, a good player will try to fend off others from obtaining the best items on the map, so it's good to at least be familiar with everything.</p>
					<p>All of the weapons can be found around maps to be picked up (excluding the Crowbar and Shotgun, the weapons you spawn with). They appear as floating models of the weapon which spin around. Simply walk into the model to obtain the weapon. Weapons like the Rocket Launcher and Lightning Gun are often in harder places to get to, and their ammunition tends to be more scarce on competitively-viable maps.</p>
					<h3>Crowbar</h3>
					<hr>
					<a target="_blank" href="/images/learn/weapons/maxres/crowbar.jpg"><img class="image-left-a" src="/images/learn/weapons/crowbar.webp" alt="crowbar.webp" width="200" height="125"></a>
					<ul class="left-img-bullet">
						<li>20 damage per hit (unarmored)</li>
						<li>Melee weapon, doesn't require ammo</li>
						<li>Swings around twice per second</li>
					</ul>
					<p>The Crowbar is one of the two weapons you spawn with and the only melee weapon in the game. It's the least effective and versatile weapon in the game. Given player movement speeds along with just generally being difficult to hit people with, its only real use is as an absolute last resort. Even then, it's probably better to run and find ammo/another weapon.</p>
					<h3>Shotgun</h3>
					<hr>
					<a target="_blank" href="/images/learn/weapons/maxres/shotgun.jpg"><img class="image-left-a" src="/images/learn/weapons/shotgun.webp" alt="shotgun.webp" width="200" height="125"></a>
					<ul class="left-img-bullet">
						<li>Damage depends on distance from target</li>
						<li>Has random bullet spread, fires six per shot</li>
						<li>Uses shotgun shells, one per shot (you spawn with 25)</li>
					</ul>
					<p>The Shotgun is the other weapon you spawn with. Until you pick up another gun, this weapon will be all you have aside from your Crowbar; your goal when you first spawn with should be to find a better weapon. This gun is best at close range and okay at medium range, but not preferable in any situation.</p>
					<h3>Super Shotgun</h3>
					<hr>
					<a target="_blank" href="/images/learn/weapons/maxres/supershotgun.jpg"><img class="image-left-a" src="/images/learn/weapons/supershotgun.webp" alt="supershotgun.webp" width="200" height="125"></a>
					<ul class="left-img-bullet">
						<li>Damage depends on distance from target</li>
						<li>Has random bullet spread, fires 12 per shot</li>
						<li>Uses shotgun shells, two per shot (you get five at pickup)</li>
					</ul>
					<p>The Super Shotgun is effectively a direct upgrade to the standard Shotgun. At the cost of using 2 shells per shot, you shoot double the amount of bullets. The spread is slightly bigger than the Shotgun, and the fire speed is also marginally slower. Regardless, there's very few situations in which you wouldn't use the Super Shotgun instead. It's arguably the best of the bullet-firing weapons. It excels at close range but can also be effective at medium range.</p>
					<h3>Nailgun</h3>
					<hr>
					<a target="_blank" href="/images/learn/weapons/maxres/nailgun.jpg"><img class="image-left-a" src="/images/learn/weapons/nailgun.webp" alt="nailgun.webp" width="200" height="125"></a>
					<ul class="left-img-bullet">
						<li>Damage depends on projectile travel distance</li>
						<li>Automatic weapon, fires around 10 shots per second</li>
						<li>Uses nails, one per shot (you get 30 at pickup)</li>
					</ul>
					<p>The Nailgun is one of two Nailguns in the game. It's fully automatic, and nails fire in an alternating manner from the two barrels on the front of the gun. It's a great weapon in the right hands, however, it's tricky to get used to since you're shooting projectiles; you have to get familiar with predicting your enemy's movements. It can excel on small, tight maps.</p>
					<h3>Super Nailgun</h3>
					<hr>
					<a target="_blank" href="/images/learn/weapons/maxres/supernailgun.jpg"><img class="image-left-a" src="/images/learn/weapons/supernailgun.webp" alt="supernailgun.webp" width="200" height="125"></a>
					<ul class="left-img-bullet">
						<li>Damage depends on projectile travel distance</li>
						<li>Automatic weapon, fires around 10 shots per second</li>
						<li>Uses nails, two per shot (you get 30 at pickup)</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Similarly to the Super Shotgun and the Shotgun, the Super Nailgun is essentially also a direct upgrade from its non-super counterpart. It's also fully automatic, but it fires twice as fast. It fires two nails at once which doubles its damage compared to the Nailgun. Unlike the Nailgun, every nail shot comes from one "barrel." It can excel on small, tight maps.</p>
					<h3>Grenade Launcher</h3>
					<hr>
					<a target="_blank" href="/images/learn/weapons/maxres/grenadelauncher.jpg"><img class="image-left-a" src="/images/learn/weapons/grenadelauncher.webp" alt="grenadelauncher.webp" width="200" height="125"></a>
					<ul class="left-img-bullet">
						<li>Damage depends on grenade distance, or if it hit directly</li>
						<li>Fires almost three grenades per second</li>
						<li>Uses rockets, one per shot (you get 15 at pickup)</li>
					</ul>
					<p>The Grenade Launcher shoots grenades that explode when they directly hit an enemy. When they don't hit an enemy, they bounce off surfaces and eventually explode after the first bounce with a delay of around two to two and a half seconds. This weapon is extremely useful if you have good aim and movement prediction. This weapon can be catastrophic for a cornered enemy. Accidentally taking damage from your own projectiles can be easy, so make sure to keep track of where your shots have landed in your fights. It does not have its own "grenade" ammo type, it uses rockets.</p>
					<h3>Rocket Launcher</h3>
					<hr>
					<a target="_blank" href="/images/learn/weapons/maxres/rocketlauncher.jpg"><img class="image-left-a" src="/images/learn/weapons/rocketlauncher.webp" alt="rocketlauncher.webp" width="200" height="125"></a>
					<ul class="left-img-bullet">
						<li>Damage depends on rocket distance, or if it hit directly</li>
						<li>Fires around three rockets every two seconds</li>
						<li>Uses rockets, one per shot (you get five at pickup)</li>
					</ul>
					<p>The Rocket Launcher is arguably the most powerful and reliable weapon in the whole game. It fires one rocket at a time and has extremely high damage. It allows the user to throw players around with its explosions, which allows for combos (also, rocket jumping). The Rocket Launcher is often considered the finest choice of weapon in most circumstances, mainly due to its high damage output, ability to toss players around, and rocket jumping. The rocket jump allows the player to shoot at the ground directly under them and fly into the air and/or forward. This makes moving around the map much easier and quicker, at the cost of some health. Rocket jumping can be extremely advantageous, and some maps have spots that you can only reach by rocket jumping.</p>
					<h3>Lightning Gun</h3>
					<hr>
					<a target="_blank" href="/images/learn/weapons/maxres/lightninggun.jpg"><img class="image-left-a" src="/images/learn/weapons/lightninggun.webp" alt="lightninggun.webp" width="200" height="125"></a>
					<ul class="left-img-bullet">
						<li>Extremely high damage output</li>
						<li>Fires around 15 cells per second</li>
						<li>Uses battery cells, one per "shot" (you get 15 at pickup)</li>
					</ul>
					<p>The Lightning Gun might sometimes be referred to by players as the "shaft." It fires a continuous light beam at players which deals very high damage. It has the highest damage output in the game, and is able to easily take down fully armored enemies in seconds provided the proper ammo and aim. Due to the scarcity of battery cells, it isn't incredibly reliable. However, many still consider it to be the best weapon in the game, if you can manage it well. Firing it while in water will instantly use every cell, dealing 18 damage per cell to every player in the water. For example, if it's fired by someone with 10 cells, 180 damage is dealt to everyone currently in the same body of water. The gun is often found in peculiar places, sometimes even in the water.</p>
