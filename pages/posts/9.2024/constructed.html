Before the state it's in now, the best we could do didnâ€™t exactly look like a "beaut" (original website shown to the right). We do hope you'll be proud of what it looks like now (we sure are), a bit more aesthetic, and with real substance too.</p>
					<p>DMC TV has been a concept for more than half a decade, and it never really had the chance to blossom into what it was originally supposed to be: a centralized hub for players of an obscure game to gather, with the hopes of fostering an active community for people to take part in and play this awesome game. We had some minor success there at first, but with such a small community, it is honestly easier said than done to rally the troops and get everyone into one Discord server, or one Steam group, or what have you.</p>
					<p>Only now have we put in the time in hopes of moving towards our original vision we had, years ago. Even though the site is up and running, we certainly have more work to do, and this is just the beginning. We plan on adding more content, and in my case, uploading links to old frag movies/clan info. I've always loved that kind of stuff. I hope you can find some value out of the site!</p>
