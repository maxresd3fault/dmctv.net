					<hr>
					<p>DMC TV is the #1 source for news, resources, and other content focused on our favorite boomer shooter. Our mission is to provide a space for those who enjoy this rather obscure title to be able to interact with other like minded players. The website is focused on pooling many things together; content from the days of old, tips and tricks, details about the game, fun facts, and more. We've always found the early days interesting; when clans were active, frag movies were a thing, etc. There is always new content we've found around old forums being added to this site, so be on the lookout!</p>
					<p>We also have  a Steam group and a Discord server which can be used to meet with others and schedule times to play. DMC TV was created in 2018 by <strong>cookiefortress</strong>. After discovering the game via purchasing the Valve Complete Pack on Steam, he decided to create a "hub" where the small amount of active players could talk with one another. Some rough drafts of a website were made, but in the end DMC TV became largely inactive in the years following its creation.</p>
					<p>In 2024, this website was launched and thus DMC TV is actively maintained now by <strong>cookiefortress</strong> as well as <strong>maxresdefault</strong>, another long-time member and player of Deathmatch Classic.</p>
					<p>Enjoy your stay, and never stop deathmatching!</p>
